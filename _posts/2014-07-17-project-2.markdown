overview: The Holmes-TOTEM Planner is responsible for turning data into information by performing feature extraction against submitted objects. When tasked, Holmes-TOTEM schedules the execution of its services which are capable of performing static and dynamic analysis as well as gather data from third parties.</p><p>The Holmes-TOTEM Investigation Planner is optimized for executing extraction services that complete in a few seconds, i.e. static analysis and 3rd party queries. When dealing with services that take longer to complete, we recommend pairing the Holmes-TOTEM Planner with Holmes-TOTEM-Long.
