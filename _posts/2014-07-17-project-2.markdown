overview: The Holmes-Totem Planner is responsible for turning data into information by performing feature extraction against submitted objects. When tasked, Holmes-Totem schedules the execution of its services which are capable of performing static and dynamic analysis as well as gather data from third parties.</p><p>The Holmes-Totem Investigation Planner is optimized for executing extraction services that complete in a few seconds, i.e. static analysis and 3rd party queries. When dealing with services that take longer to complete, we recommend pairing the Holmes-Totem Planner with Holmes-Totem-Dynamic.
